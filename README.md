TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( http://github.com/jaredcwhite/opal-shimmer/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)

## Testing

Simply run `rackup` at your command line when you're in the project folder. It will load a webserver at port 9292. Then just go to your browser (hint: if you're regularly a Safari use, like I am, for some reason this doesn't work; you have to use Chrome instead...) and access `http://localhost:9292`. You should get the full rspec suite runner output. (And hopefully, everything's green!)
